# Giggle Chat App

Giggle is a real-time chat application built using React and Firebase, designed to facilitate seamless communication and instant notifications between users. Whether you're connecting with friends, making new connections, or staying in touch with loved ones, Giggle makes chat and notifications easy and engaging.

## Objective

The primary objective of Giggle is to create a robust real-time chat and notifications feature, providing users with the ability to send and receive chat messages instantly. Additionally, users should receive notifications for new matches (talk requests) and incoming messages. We've divided the project into two main components: frontend and backend.

## Features

- **React-Powered Real-Time Updates**: Leveraging React, Giggle handles real-time message updates seamlessly, thanks to its integration with Firebase.

- **User-Friendly Chat Initiation**: Initiating new chat conversations is a breeze, promoting user engagement and interaction.

- **Engaging Notifications**: Giggle delivers clear and engaging notifications to keep users informed about new matches and messages.

### Backend (Firebase)

- **Firebase Firestore**: We've set up Firebase Firestore to store chat messages, user data, and notifications securely.
